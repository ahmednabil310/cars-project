        <b>Guidance for the car lovers </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Trying to figure out which car, truck, or SUV you should buy? Deciding
        between multiple vehicles can be a chore if you don't have the right
        tools. Just select the cars you're interested in from our comprehensive
        list of car models from 1990 till today.
        <br />
        Our powerful car comparison tool lets you compare multiple vehicles, so
        you can see how they stack up at a glance. Compare features, warranties,
        engines, fuel economy, passenger room and trunk space. See ratings and
        pros and cons for each vehicle, and compare not just MSRP but what
        people are actually paying and dealer invoice prices. You can compare
        competitive vehicles, or compare different trim levels or model years of
        the same car.
        <br />
        Our comparator isn't just about figuring out which car is better, it's
        about figuring out which car is best for you. Compare more than thrity
        easy-to-read data points, and find out what our editors and users think
        of each vehicle on your list.

        <b> Comprehend about The Specifications </b> <br />
        <br />
        The table lists out the various prices and engine choices available for
        a particular model. The listed prices are listed as a range from the
        base price price to the full-options price, as seen in the central city
        of Dubai. Be aware that price are subject to inflation and dealer
        markups, so expect variations between 10% and 20% from the listed prices
        at the actual showroom. It is best to call your local dealer for actual
        prices.
        <br />
        To understand the abbr/eviated entries within the specifications table,
        use these keys;

        <b> Reliability And Resale Value Ratings</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The reliability ratings here are not based on any calculation. It is
        more of a subjective rating, based on the number of known problems, as
        well as the severity of those problems. It gives a rough idea of how
        often the owner of the car may face problems. All known problems are
        also listed, but only for cars older than three years in general.
        <br />
        Similarly, the resale value ratings are based on relative prices in the
        used car market, and may vary depending on the mileage, condition and
        modifications done on the car. It should be used more as a reference on
        how easily a particular car model will sell compared to another similar
        model. For example, among midsize cars, a five-star Toyota Camry will be
        in higher demand and sell for a higher price than a three-star VW Passat
        from the same production year.
        <br />
        <b>Safety Ratings </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The safety ratings are taken directly from American NHTSA and European
        EuroNCAP governmental crash tests. Results for crash tests performed by
        American NHTSA and European EuroNCAP governmental agencies are available
        via their respective websites, although data is not available for all
        models. Note that models sold in the GCC occasionally come with fewer
        safety features than the same models sold elsewhere. For example, while
        side-airbags are standard in most cars in the United States, most cars
        in the GCC do not have side-airbags.
        <br />
        <br />
        The NHTSA ratings listed in our guide are only for a straight front-end
        crash at 56 kph, and based on injuries to the driver only. The fewer the
        injuries, the higher the number of stars. Front-passenger ratings are
        separately rated by the NHTSA, but are generally better than driver
        ratings anyway.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additional tests listed on the NHTSA website include side-impact and
        rollover crashes, each rated separately. Looking at these other ratings
        in general, cars with side-airbags offer much more protection than cars
        without them. And 4WDs have a higher tendency to roll over than cars.
        Also, cars and 4WDs with stability control (ESP) are less likely to roll
        over.
        <br />
        <br />
        The EuroNCAP ratings are more of an average, taking into account 64 kph
        front impacts, 50 kph side impacts and 29 kph pole impacts, as well as
        both driver and passenger seating positions. However, the EuroNCAP has
        separate ratings for adults and children. Only the adult ratings are
        listed in our guide. Where EuroNCAP ratings were not available, we
        listed Australian ANCAP ratings, which uses identical standards.
        <br />
        <br />
        Additional tests listed on the EuroNCAP website show that children
        generally fare worse than adults in any accident, no matter what the
        vehicle, even taking into account child booster seats. The EuroNCAP also
        rates pedestrian safety separately, showing how likely a pedestrian is
        going to be injured when hit by a particular car.
